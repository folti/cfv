cfv 1.18.3  Copyright 2000-2009 Matthew Mueller <donut AT dakotacom DOT net>


Requirements:
  Python >= 1.6           http://www.python.org/
    (Python >= 2.3 is recommended for best unicode support)

Optional:
  Python Imaging Library  http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
    (only needed if you want to create the dimensions column of .crc files)
  python-fchksum          http://www.dakotacom.net/~donut/programs/fchksum.html
    (may speed up checksumming speed a bit, especially if your python
     wasn't built with the mmap module.)
  BitTorrent              http://www.bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/
    (modules must be in the python search path to allow .torrent checking.)

Unix Install:
1) run make with no arguments to see possible installation methods
2) run your chosen method (or manually put cfv and cfv.1 where you want)
3) read man page, cfv -h, etc.  have fun.
4) optional: run tests to verify correct operation: cd test; ./test.py

Windows Install:
1) move cfv.py to c:\python24\lib\site-packages\
2) move cfv.bat to somewhere in the path
3) Edit the cfv.bat file if your python is installed somewhere other than 
  c:\python24 (and obviously you'll need to change the path in step 1 too.)
